# FizzBuzzTree

## Travis
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/shiratap/data-structures-and-algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/shiratap/data-structures-and-algorithms)

## Challenge
Change all values that are divisible by both 5 and 3 to FizzBuzz, 5 to Buzz, 3 to Fizz

## Approach & Efficiency
Traverse the list from the root with a preorder traversal, compare if it's a target value, make the switch to that value

## Solution
