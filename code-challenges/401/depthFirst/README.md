# Depth First Traversal

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/shiratap/data-structures-and-algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/shiratap/data-structures-and-algorithms)

## Challenge
Given an adj list, return an arr that is in a depth first order

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O
  - Space: O(h) => how high the callstack is
  - Time: O(n) => Needs to hit every node

## Solution
