# Singly Linked List
Linked List algorithm

## Challenge
Create a LinkedList class that contains several node classes. LinkedList should contain several methods that add, prints, and checks if a value is included in one of it's nodes

## Approach & Efficiency
Linked list class contains the methods as asked.
Node has 2 properties

## API
LinkedList
