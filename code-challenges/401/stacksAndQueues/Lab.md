Features
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.
Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.
Define a method called push which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
Define a method called pop that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the node’s value.
Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on the top of the stack.
Create a Queue class that has a top property. It creates an empty queue when instantiated.
This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.
Define a method called enqueue which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
Define a method called dequeue that does not take any argument, removes the node from the front of the queue, and returns the node’s value.
Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located in the front of the stack.
At no time should an exception or stack trace be shown to the end user. Catch and handle any such exceptions and return a printed value or operation which cleanly represents the state and either stops execution cleanly, or provides the user with clear direction and output.
Be sure to follow your languages best practices for naming conventions.
You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class.

Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write tests to prove the following functionality:

Can successfully push onto a stack
Can successfully push multiple nodes onto a stack
Can successfully pop off the stack
Can successfully empty a stack after multiple pops.
Can successfully peek the next item on the stack.
Can successfully instantiate an empty stack
Can successfully enqueue onto a queue
Can successfully enqueue multiple items into a queue
Can successfully dequeue off of a queue the expected value
Can successfully peek into a queue, seeing the expected value
Can successfully empty a queue after multiple dequeues
Can successfully instantiate an empty queue
